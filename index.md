## Background
During high school, I integrated a text sentiment analysis model with a LINE interface as part of a self-directed learning project, focusing mainly on writing the report. Recently, I noticed that LINE updated its development kit, so while upgrading, I also took the opportunity to enhance the interface design. Iâ€™ve shared the results online for others to reference.
